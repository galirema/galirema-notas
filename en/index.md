# Muna

Muna is a conlang I've been developing for years, it has undergone dramatic revisions, sometimes trashing the entire concept and starting anew after the project sidetracked too much.

## Goals

* A language that's easy to pronounce but is not too similar to any existing language
* A language with an interesting, yet not too complex, grammar
