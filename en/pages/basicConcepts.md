# Basic Concepts

## Phonology

A CVM syllable structure where C is any consonant, V is any vowel or diphthong and M is a modifying coda (R, N, H). The modifying coda is one of three archphonemes that may modify the nucleus depending on the dialect. R rhotacizes the vowels, N nasalizes them and H devoices them.

The syllable /kaR/ may be pronounced [ka˞], [ka˞ː], [ka˞ɾ] or [kaɾ], depending on the dialect of muna.
